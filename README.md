# Introduction
DeepStack is an artificial intelligence API engine that serves pre-built models and custom models on multiple edge devices locally or on your private cloud. Supported platforms are:

- **Linux OS** via Docker ( CPU and NVIDIA GPU support )
- **Mac OS** via Docker
- **Windows 10** (as a Native Application)
- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano** via Docker.

DeepStack runs completely offline and independent of the cloud when installed on an edge device. You can also install and run DeepStack on any cloud VM with docker installed to serve as your private, state-of-the-art and real-time Artficial intelligence server with `unlimited API calls`.
